# Rule Workflow

**Triggers:** *"Add rule"*, *"Add convention"*, *"Amend rule"*, *"Remove rule"*
**Scope:** Direct management of RULES.md §7 Project Conventions.
Automatic rule capture during spec work is handled by `specification.md`.

> **Full implementation:** `.magic/rule.md`
> Read that file before proceeding. Do not execute any steps until it is read.

# Plan Workflow

**Triggers:** *"Create plan"*, *"Generate plan"*, *"Update plan"*, *"Reprioritize"*
**Scope:** Prioritization, phasing, dependency analysis, and implementation order.
Specification authoring is handled by `specification.md`.

> **Full implementation:** `.magic/plan.md`
> Read that file before proceeding. Do not execute any steps until it is read.

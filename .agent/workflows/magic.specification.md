# Specification Workflow

**Triggers:** *"Create spec"*, *"Update spec"*, *"Audit specs"*, *"Review registry"*
**Scope:** Specification authoring — what exists and how it is structured.
Planning and execution are handled by `magic.plan` and `magic.task`.

> **Full implementation:** `.magic/specification.md`
> Read that file before proceeding. Do not execute any steps until it is read.

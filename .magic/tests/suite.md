# Workflow Test Suite

**Version:** 1.7.0
**Purpose:** Regression testing for Magic SDD engine workflows.
**Trigger:** `/magic.simulate test`

## How to Run

The agent reads this file, simulates each test scenario against the target workflow's logic, and reports PASS/FAIL for each expected outcome. No real files are created — all state is synthetic.

### Pass Criteria

A test **passes** if the workflow logic (as written in `.magic/*.md`) would produce the expected outcome given the synthetic state. A test **fails** if:

- A required guard is missing or would not trigger.
- The workflow would produce an incorrect or undefined result.
- An edge case is silently ignored instead of flagged.

### Report Format

After all tests, present a summary table:

```
Workflow Test Suite — {date}

| ID | Workflow | Scenario | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| T01 | init | Fresh cold start | ✅ PASS |
| T02 | init | Partial corruption | ❌ FAIL |
...

Total: {N} passed, {M} failed out of {T}
```

If any test fails, document the failure reason and propose a fix.

## Test Scenarios

### T01 — Fresh Init Cold Start

- **Workflow:** `init.md`
- **Synthetic State:**
  - `.design/` does not exist
  - `.magic/.checksums` is valid
  - No git repository (optional)
- **Action:** Calling workflow triggers init via `check-prerequisites → ok: false`
- **Expected:**
  - [ ] `node .magic/scripts/executor.js init` is called
  - [ ] Post-init verification checks all 5 artifacts: `INDEX.md`, `RULES.md`, `specifications/`, `tasks/`, `archives/tasks/`
  - [ ] Brief report: "SDD initialized — {date}"
  - [ ] Calling workflow continues after init
- **Guards tested:** Engine Integrity check, post-init verification (5 artifacts)

### T02 — Init Partial Corruption

- **Workflow:** `init.md`
- **Synthetic State:**
  - `.design/` exists
  - `RULES.md` exists, `INDEX.md` is missing
  - `specifications/` exists, `tasks/` is missing
- **Action:** check-prerequisites → `ok: false` (missing required files) → init triggered
- **Expected:**
  - [ ] Init script runs and creates only missing artifacts (INDEX.md, tasks/)
  - [ ] Existing RULES.md is NOT overwritten (idempotency)
  - [ ] Post-init verification confirms all 5 artifacts present
- **Guards tested:** Safe to Re-Run (idempotency), full verification

### T03 — Spec Dispatch Multi-Topic

- **Workflow:** `spec.md` (Dispatching from Raw Input)
- **Synthetic State:**
  - `.design/` initialized with 2 existing specs: `architecture.md` (Stable), `api.md` (Draft)
  - `RULES.md` v1.2.0 with C1–C6
- **Input:** `"We need JWT auth with Redis sessions. Also, the API must use REST only. And we should use shadcn for the UI."`
- **Expected:**
  - [ ] Parse: 3 distinct topics identified
  - [ ] Map: JWT+Redis → `architecture.md`, REST → `architecture.md`, shadcn → new `ui-components.md`
  - [ ] Confirm: mapping shown to user before writing
  - [ ] New file `ui-components.md` created from `.magic/templates/specification.md`
  - [ ] INDEX.md updated with new entry
  - [ ] Post-Update Review runs on all modified files
- **Guards tested:** Multi-topic dispatch, new file creation with template, registry sync

### T04 — Spec Intra-Input Self-Contradiction

- **Workflow:** `spec.md` (Dispatching from Raw Input)
- **Synthetic State:**
  - `.design/` initialized, `api.md` (Stable)
- **Input:** `"All APIs must use GraphQL. Also, REST is mandatory for mobile. And we plan to remove REST entirely in 2 months."`
- **Expected:**
  - [ ] Parse: 3 topics, all mapped to `api.md`
  - [ ] **Self-contradiction detected** before dispatch (GraphQL mandatory + REST mandatory + REST removal)
  - [ ] Agent flags all internal conflicts
  - [ ] Agent asks user to resolve before mapping — does NOT guess precedence
  - [ ] No writes occur until user resolves
- **Guards tested:** Intra-input self-contradiction edge case

### T05 — Spec Deprecation Cascade

    - Project root has: `package.json`, `src/`, `README.md`, 20+ source files
  - **Action:** Any workflow triggers init
  - **Expected:**
    - [ ] Init runs: `.design/` created with all 5 artifacts
    - [ ] Post-init: codebase indicators scanned — `package.json` found
    - [ ] Hint appended: `💡 Existing codebase detected. To generate initial specifications from your code, say: "Analyze project"`
    - [ ] Calling workflow continues after hint
- **Test B — Empty project (no code):**
  - **Synthetic State:**
    - `.design/` does NOT exist
    - Project root has only `.magic/` (freshly installed magic-spec, no user code)
  - **Action:** Any workflow triggers init
  - **Expected:**
    - [ ] Init runs: `.design/` created with all 5 artifacts
    - [ ] Post-init: no codebase indicators found
    - [ ] **No hint** — analysis not suggested for empty projects
    - [ ] Calling workflow continues
- **Guards tested:** Codebase detection heuristic, hint presence/absence

### T33 — Analyze Depth Control for Large Projects

- **Workflow:** `analyze.md` (Depth Control)
- **Test A — Small project (<50 files):**
  - **Synthetic State:**
    - 30 source files, `.design/INDEX.md` empty
  - **Expected:**
    - [ ] Full scan starts automatically — no prompt
- **Test B — Medium project (50–500 files):**
  - **Synthetic State:**
    - 200 source files, `.design/INDEX.md` empty
  - **Expected:**
    - [ ] Agent offers: Full scan or Focused scan
    - [ ] Proceeds only after user choice
- **Test C — Large project (>500 files):**
  - **Synthetic State:**
    - 1200 source files across 80 directories, `.design/INDEX.md` empty
  - **Expected:**
    - [ ] Agent recommends Focused or Quick scan
    - [ ] Full scan offered as option but not default
    - [ ] Agent does NOT auto-start full scan on large projects
- **Guards tested:** Depth Control thresholds (<50, 50–500, >500), auto-scan vs prompt

### T34 — Simulate Missing Test Suite (Improv Mode Fallback)

- **Workflow:** `simulate.md` (Improv Mode)
- **Synthetic State:**
  - `.magic/tests/suite.md` file is missing or inaccessible.
- **Action 1:** User runs `/magic.simulate test`
- **Expected 1:**
  - [ ] Agent checks for `.magic/tests/suite.md` and fails to find it.
  - [ ] Agent alerts user that test suite is missing and falls back to **Improv Mode**.
  - [ ] Agent synthesizes a complex "Crisis Scenario" (e.g., INDEX.md desync).
  - [ ] Agent runs an end-to-end simulated lifecycle (Spec → Task → Run → Retro).
  - [ ] Agent outputs a Friction Audit report with identified "Rough Edges".
- **Action 2:** User runs `/magic.simulate` (without target), user requests generic "live simulation"
- **Expected 2:**
  - [ ] Agent defaults to **Improv Mode**.
  - [ ] Executes the same synthesis and lifecycle end-to-end as Expected 1.
- **Guards tested:** Fallback trigger on missing tests, Improv Mode end-to-end execution, ambiguity handling

### T35 — Run Sequence Syncs to PLAN.md

- **Workflow:** `run.md` (Executing Tasks)
- **Synthetic State:**
  - `TASKS.md` Phase 1 has 2 tasks mapped to `auth.md`.
  - Both tasks are transition to marked `Done` after execution.
  - `PLAN.md` has `[ ] Implement Auth module` pointing to `auth.md` under Phase 1.
- **Action:** User says "Execute tasks"
- **Expected:**
  - [ ] Agent reads TASKS.md and identifies fully implemented spec (`auth.md`).
  - [ ] Agent modifies `.design/PLAN.md` to change `[ ]` to `[x]` for `auth.md`.
  - [ ] TASKS.md updated with `Done`.
- **Guards tested:** Plan Sync mechanism (Plan Amnesia fix)

### T36 — Run Task Blocked Handoff to spec.md

- **Workflow:** `run.md` (Executing Tasks)
- **Synthetic State:**
  - `TASKS.md` Phase 2 has 1 active task mapped to `auth.md`.
  - Task execution encounters ambiguous or missing details in the specification.
- **Action:** User executes `/magic.run`
- **Expected:**
  - [ ] Agent records `Blocked` status and the specific reason in `TASKS.md` Notes.
  - [ ] Agent utilizes the newly added `magic.spec` handoff in `.agent/workflows/magic.run.md`.
  - [ ] Agent delegates resolution to `magic.spec` workflow (Explore/Update Mode).
  - [ ] Once the specification is formally updated and unblocked, agent proceeds to `magic.task` to rebuild task dependencies.
- **Guards tested:** Cross-workflow handoff routing, blocked task escalation.

### T37 — Simulate Regression Sweep Post-Fix

- **Workflow:** `simulate.md` (Verification Step)
- **Synthetic State:**
  - Logic flaw found in a workflow definition (e.g. `init.md`).
  - Surgical fix applied.
  - Test case appended to `suite.md`.
- **Action:** User explicitly approves the "Corrective Proposal" changes.
- **Expected:**
  - [ ] Agent performs a spot-check of the modified lines in `init.md`.
  - [ ] Agent explicitly utilizes the *Run regression tests* handoff from `.agent/workflows/magic.simulate.md` or directly triggers the `/magic.simulate test` suite.
  - [ ] Full regression suite is executed sequentially to ensure core `init.md` modifications did not break adjacent workflows.
- **Guards tested:** Post-fix regression sweep enforcement.
